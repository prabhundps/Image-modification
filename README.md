In image modification, you'll come across that how image can be modified using convolution method like sharpening the images, 
blurring the images based on x-axis and y-axis of blurring matrix

Please find the python implemented code.

Here, two files i'm including now
1. python file of code, which needs scikit learn and openCV package of python.
2. Image in jpeg format but it could be run in any format of images

to run this program,

use command-
python convolution.py --image image_file.jpeg
